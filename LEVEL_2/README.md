This time, you cann't rely on the `Details` to search the bug. The only info you get is the related files of the bug exist. For me, I will find the patch file, and write down its path. Then I will try to find the bug and check whether these files exist this bug to provide the right file. 

Find the bug yourself, and if you feel difficult can see tips or the answer. 

I believe you can do better than me.
