# Exercise 2

In LEVEL 1, we can relay on Details and just to search for the func which Details mentioned. It is far away from the real bug hunting scene. therefore in LEVEL 2 we do the same as LEVEL 1 without the help of Details.

## CVE-2021-21122
I sugget you don't search any report about it to prevents get too much info like patch. Our goal is to find some bugs, not construct Poc. But in truth, Poc can proof that we are right.
